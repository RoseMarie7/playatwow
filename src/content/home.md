          Hi, I'm RoseMarie, and I'm happy you're here !  I invite you to step
          into a safe space that's both magical and empowering. By visiting my
          site, you've already taken the first step on a transformative journey
          - a journey that's about you. A journey to discover your joy, your
          fulfillment, and your ability to thrive no matter what life throws
          your way.  Thriving through change isn't a flawless journey, it’s a
          messy, beautiful one. I know because I've experienced it.


          I'm a certified professional career and life coach. Coaching is not
          just my profession, it's my passion.  I believe every one of us has
          the power to live authentically, with confidence, wonder, and joy.  I
          am here to help you tap into that power.  Whether you're navigating
          your next career move, seeking personal fulfillment, or reimagining
          retirement, I'm here as your partner and guide. My coaching programs
          are tailored to enrich every aspect of your well-being.


          I embrace the philosophy of Life Harmony—viewing work as an integral,
          harmonious part of life, rather than something separate. Together,
          we'll craft a symphony of all life’s elements that resonates with what
          I call Play at WOW.


          With over 15 years as a proud member of the International Coaching
          Federation, I bring experience, dedication, and heart to every
          session. Let's work together to help you thrive!
