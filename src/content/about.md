        content: >
          I'm a certified professional coach and facilitator with a passion for
          helping people tap into their full potential - a passion shaped over
          three decades of corporate experience.


          Throughout my career, I had the privilege of leading teams across
          marketing, supply chain, finance, learning and development, and
          business excellence. While achieving results was rewarding, what
          fulfilled me most was seeing individuals and teams rise, thrive, and
          stretch beyond what they thought possible. In the later chapters of my
          corporate journey, I shifted my focus toward coaching, helping teams
          spark innovation and lead transformative change. Through these
          experiences, I discovered that beyond talent and hard work, there was
          another powerful catalyst for success: play. It became clear to me
          that play is the magic behind those “WOW” moments that inspire,
          energize, and create lasting impact.


          While I have received professional recognition and awards along the
          way, my most rewarding role has always been being a mom to two amazing
          children. Years ago, during an interview for National Post Business
          Magazine, back when I was the Marketing Manager for a top beverage
          brand, the reporter surprised me. She was less interested in my
          product launch and more fascinated by how I was balancing a demanding 
          career with a three-year-old and one-year-old at home. Having given up
          on the concept of work/life balance, I told her, “Now I strive for
          harmony. Sometimes I have to give more to my family, and sometimes to
          work. It’s never going to work out evenly, but if it’s harmonious,
          nothing suffers.”  That insight became a guiding truth in my life.


          I’ve been fortunate to celebrate meaningful accomplishments, from
          career milestones to cherished moments with family. Yet, my journey
          hasn’t been without struggle. Multi-tasking through countless roles
          left me stretched thin, and somewhere in the mix, I began to lose
          myself. Who was I? Was I showing up fully as a mom and a leader? What
          did I truly want from life? Then grief entered my life and that
          stirred deeper questions about purpose and fulfillment. It was during
          that turning point that I began a journey to rediscover my true self,
          not the version shaped by the outside world.. This exploration led me
          to my calling as a mentor and coach. The more I stepped into alignment
          with my authentic path, the more my happiness and fulfillment grew.


          Today, I hold space for women navigating change. I guide them back to
          their truth, helping them embrace play, purpose, and personal power.
          Play at WOW isn’t just a coaching  company, it’s a way of being. And
          “Where Wonder Meets YOU” is the invitation I extend to every woman
          ready to explore, grow, and thrive through change.

          My mission as a Career and Life Coach is to empower and inspire my
          clients to live a life that is authentic, fulfilling, and aligned with
          their values and strengths.  I believe that everyone has the potential
          to create positive change in their lives, and I am here to support you
          on your journey of personal growth and transformation.


          At the heart of the Play at WOW approach is a holistic, creative, and
          fun method for awakening possibility. Through proven strategies and
          tools, I help you build greater awareness, make empowered choices, and
          generate impactful results—step by step.


          No matter what role you play in the game of life, it's how you play
          that will determine your success.   Whether you’re a leader guiding a
          team, a student striving to excel, or a woman managing her busy life,
          it's the integrity, effort, and energy that you bring to your actions
          that make the difference. Success isn’t just about reaching the finish
          line; it’s about the journey, the lessons learned, and the positive
          impact you make along the way.


          At Play at WOW, I guide  individuals and teams to  embrace the journey
          with play, purpose, and personal power. My coaching programs  have
          supported clients across business, healthcare and education.
